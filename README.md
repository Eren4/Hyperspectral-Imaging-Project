# Hyperspectral Imaging Project  

Term project for my "Exploratory Data Analysis with MATLAB" course. I did this project during my junior year  
  
The 9th step which was about SVM is missing since I didn't know how to apply it  
  
The data Pavia Centre is missing since the file size is too large for uploading it to GitHub
